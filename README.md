*Fear*...or overcoming it. Fear of being left behind, fear of the unknown, 
fear of beginning

Given this what should be done about fear and it’s binding hold? I can only 
speak for self I took one step and then I will take another and another I 
will keep on stepping until I am done. 
So in this step I have installed VVV but to do this I had to install vagrant 
and to do that I had to install Oracle VM VirtualBox a time consuming and 
lengthy process. The use of command line is good a lot of systems use this 
and it will help me in the future. I used the Git Bash application for the 
command line, waiting for vagrant to load was stressful as it is like 
nothing I have seen and by the time it takes I can only imagine it is 
using a lot of resources but as I looked at task manager it didn’t seem to 
be, it was the biggest user of resources but there still was plenty of 
overhead.
Wordpress was running localy and I made a site about bees. The fear is 
still with me but it is smaller now.
